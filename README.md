# Enum-Automation
A handy tool to create custom luau enumerations!
Setup the hierarchy of the enumeration under the json file named "input.json"

Run the script in command, preferrably using bash, by typing:

**Scripts/run.sh [YOUR_INPUT_PATH] [YOUR_OUTPUT_PATH]**

For example, you would do Scripts/run.sh ./input.json ./OutputExamples/out.lua if your input path is ./input.json and your output path is ./OutputExamples/out.lua
